You will have to write a script that takes the following parameters:
a string representing a path: it is mandatory: $path
a date, mandatory $date
a string that will represent the path for the output file - should have a default value $archivePath

You will need to get all the txt files last modified before $date under the path you recieved as an argument and archive them. The resulting .zip file should have the name and path from the third parameter.

Notes:
looking for files under $path should also check subfolders, meaning it should be recursive
the files once archived should be removed 
for zipping you should use native windows commands
it is good practice to check if the parameters are correct
Tip: there is a DateTime data type in powershell
